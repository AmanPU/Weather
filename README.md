CoreLocation  : Core Location provides services for determining a deviceâ€™s geographic location, altitude, orientation, or position relative to a nearby iBeacon. The framework uses all available onboard hardware, including Wi-Fi, GPS, Bluetooth, magnetometer, barometer, and cellular hardware to gather data.


Mapkit : Display map or satellite imagery directly from your app's interface, call out points of interest, and determine placemark information for map coordinates.
